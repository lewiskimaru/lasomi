## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to building a professional React frontend for the Atlas GIS API. By following this timeline and checklist approach, a junior developer can deliver a high-quality, maintainable web application that meets all user requirements while providing an excellent user experience.

Remember: It's better to build features incrementally and test frequently than to build everything at once. Focus on getting core functionality working first, then add polish and optimization.

Good luck with your implementation! ðŸš€
