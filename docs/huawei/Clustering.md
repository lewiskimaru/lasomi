now lets talk about clustering, help me think trough how SDU clustering should work, like we have SDUs in an area and we need to group them into a cluster adn each cluster can have a maximum of 32 homes since this is the total number of possible connections per Subbox chain, we then need to make sure we cluster the buildings by following the road networks since we need  to make sure that they are easily accessible, please help me think through how this would look, dont make a markdown file just explain if this is even possible, to cluster SDUs in an area of interest into polygons (note that an area of interest can have more than one cluster) also the DQODN solution has something called a branch box which allows the cable to be split in two separate directions (one cluster can only have one branch box) in the case that the homes to be served area in different directions, given the road network, the road network is a key determinant of the clustering of SDUs



now i am thinking should we first cluster then design or should we first design, because clustering is super complex and so is design. basically we need to start at the home (SDU) level and then we need to look at the position of the Xbox or the OLT and then we need to see what paths exist to this central office given the available poles and the road network and then we can group together the paths that intersect, like if SDUs share a pole on this path then they are apart of the same cluster, we can go like down up approach we can see how many SDUs share the poles as we go up the path and then we can keep grouping them until we get to 32 homes or we have them in different directions, if they are coming from different directions then they cant be cluetred together since a branch box is for buildings in different directions within a cluster



please help me think about the clustering approach and rules since this is one of the most critical parts of the system

This is a \*\*genuinely hard problem\*\*, and I'm glad you're thinking deeply about it. Let me break down why this is complex and help you think through viable approaches.

\## The Fundamental Tension



You've identified the core problem: \*\*Clustering and routing are interdependent.\*\*



\- \*\*If you cluster first:\*\* You might group homes that have no feasible cable path between them

\- \*\*If you route first:\*\* You don't know which homes to route to until you cluster them



This is a classic \*\*chicken-and-egg problem\*\* in network design.



---



\## Why Traditional Clustering Won't Work



\*\*Standard k-means/hierarchical clustering assumes:\*\*

\- Euclidean distance (straight lines)

\- No constraints on path topology

\- No consideration of infrastructure



\*\*But DQODN reality:\*\*

\- Distance is \*\*network distance\*\* (along roads/poles), not straight-line

\- Cables \*\*must follow roads\*\* and connect to \*\*available poles\*\*

\- A cluster is only valid if there's a \*\*physically feasible cascade path\*\* through it

\- The \*\*branch box rule\*\* adds directional constraints



\*\*Example of failure:\*\*

Imagine 32 homes clustered by geographic proximity, but they're on opposite sides of a river with only one bridge 2km away. Standard clustering would group them; your system needs to split them.



---



\## The Right Approach: \*\*Path-Based Clustering (Bottom-Up)\*\*



Your instinct is \*\*100% correct\*\*. You need to work \*\*from homes → CO\*\*, not the other way around.



\### Core Insight:

\*\*"SDUs that share poles on their path to the CO can potentially be in the same cluster"\*\*



This is the right heuristic. Let me formalize it:



---



\## Proposed Algorithm: \*\*Road-Network Constrained Clustering\*\*



\### Phase 1: Build the Network Graph



```

1\. Create graph G = (V, E)

&nbsp;  - Nodes (V): 

&nbsp;    \* All poles (existing, new, third-party)

&nbsp;    \* XBox/OLT location

&nbsp;    \* All SDU locations

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  - Edges (E):

&nbsp;    \* Road segments between poles

&nbsp;    \* "Last mile" connections (SDU → nearest pole)

&nbsp;  

&nbsp;  - Edge weights:

&nbsp;    \* Distance (meters)

&nbsp;    \* Pole capacity (0 if full, 1 if available)

&nbsp;    \* Ownership penalty (third-party poles = higher cost)

```



\*\*Critical:\*\* This graph represents \*\*physically possible cable paths\*\*, not just roads.



---



\### Phase 2: Generate Candidate Paths (SDU → CO)



```

For each SDU:

&nbsp; 1. Find shortest path to XBox/OLT using Dijkstra

&nbsp; 2. Record:

&nbsp;    - Path sequence: \[SDU → Pole1 → Pole2 → ... → XBox]

&nbsp;    - Total distance

&nbsp;    - Poles used

&nbsp; 

&nbsp; Result: Every SDU has a "primary access path"

```



\*\*What you now have:\*\* A set of paths from each home to the central office.



---



\### Phase 3: Find Path Overlaps (This is the clustering key)



```

For each pair of SDUs:

&nbsp; 1. Compare their paths to the CO

&nbsp; 2. Find the "merge point" (first common pole)

&nbsp; 3. Calculate "shared path length" (distance from merge point to CO)

&nbsp; 

&nbsp; Insight: SDUs with high shared path length should cluster together

```



\*\*Example:\*\*

```

CO ← Pole A ← Pole B ← Pole C ← Pole D ← SDU1

&nbsp;                        ↑

&nbsp;                     Pole E ← SDU2



Shared path: Pole C → Pole B → Pole A → CO

These two SDUs are good cluster candidates!

```



---



\### Phase 4: Hierarchical Path-Based Clustering



\*\*Algorithm sketch:\*\*



```python

def path\_based\_clustering(sdus, paths, max\_cluster\_size=32):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   Bottom-up clustering based on path overlap

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   while unclustered:

&nbsp;       # Start new cluster with SDU closest to CO

&nbsp;       seed\_sdu = min(unclustered, key=lambda s: path\_length(s, CO))

&nbsp;       cluster = \[seed\_sdu]

&nbsp;       unclustered.remove(seed\_sdu)

&nbsp;       

&nbsp;       # Greedily add SDUs with highest path overlap

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   return True

```



---



\## Handling the Branch Box



\*\*The branch box is crucial\*\* because it allows \*\*directional splits within a cluster\*\*.



\### Rule:

> "A cluster can have homes in two directions from a common pole, but only if we use a branch box"



\*\*How to detect this in clustering:\*\*



```python

def detect\_branch\_requirement(cluster, paths):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   Determine if cluster needs a branch box

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Find the common merge pole for all SDUs in cluster

&nbsp;   merge\_pole = find\_common\_merge\_point(\[paths\[sdu] for sdu in cluster])

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Group SDUs by which "branch" they're on from merge pole

&nbsp;   branches = group\_by\_branch(cluster, merge\_pole, paths)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   if len(branches) == 1:

&nbsp;       return False, None  # Linear cascade, no branch needed

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   elif len(branches) == 2:

&nbsp;       return True, merge\_pole  # Need branch box at merge pole

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   else:

&nbsp;       # More than 2 branches = invalid cluster, must split

&nbsp;       return None, None  # Signals invalid cluster

```



\*\*Example topology:\*\*



```

&nbsp;             CO

&nbsp;              |

&nbsp;         Pole (HubBox)

&nbsp;              |

&nbsp;         Branch Box

&nbsp;            /   \\

&nbsp;       Path A   Path B

&nbsp;        /          \\

&nbsp;   SDUs (16)     SDUs (16)

&nbsp;   

Branch box splits the fiber into two directions

Each direction has 2 SubBoxes (8 homes each)

```



---



\## The Directional Constraint



\*\*Key insight:\*\* You can't cluster homes if their "approach angles" to the common pole are too different.



```python

def calculate\_approach\_angle(sdu\_path, merge\_pole):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   Calculate the direction from which this SDU approaches the merge pole

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   # Get the pole immediately before merge pole in SDU's path

&nbsp;   prev\_pole = sdu\_path\[sdu\_path.index(merge\_pole) - 1]

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Calculate bearing from prev\_pole to merge\_pole

&nbsp;   angle = calculate\_bearing(prev\_pole, merge\_pole)

&nbsp;   return angle





def can\_cluster\_with\_branch(sdu1\_path, sdu2\_path, merge\_pole):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   Check if two SDUs can be in same cluster using branch box

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   angle1 = calculate\_approach\_angle(sdu1\_path, merge\_pole)

&nbsp;   angle2 = calculate\_approach\_angle(sdu2\_path, merge\_pole)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   angle\_diff = abs(angle1 - angle2)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # If approach angles differ by ~90-180°, they're in different directions

&nbsp;   # This is valid for branch box use

&nbsp;   if 60 <= angle\_diff <= 180:

&nbsp;       return True

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # If angles are too similar, they're on same path (no branch needed)

&nbsp;   elif angle\_diff < 30:

&nbsp;       return True

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Angles 30-60° are ambiguous (might cause cable routing issues)

&nbsp;   else:

&nbsp;       return False

```



---



\## Clustering Validation Rules



After generating clusters, validate each one:



```python

def validate\_cluster(cluster, paths, poles):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   Ensure cluster meets DQODN constraints

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   checks = {

&nbsp;       'size': len(cluster) <= 32,

&nbsp;       'cascade\_length': calculate\_total\_cascade\_length(cluster) <= 2000,  # Max 2km

&nbsp;       'pole\_capacity': all\_poles\_have\_capacity(cluster, poles),

&nbsp;       'split\_ratio': len(cluster) in \[16, 32],  # Prefer even split ratios

&nbsp;       'branch\_count': count\_required\_branches(cluster, paths) <= 1,

&nbsp;       'loss\_budget': calculate\_max\_loss(cluster, paths) <= 26.0  # dB

&nbsp;   }

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   return all(checks.values()), checks

```



---



\## Dealing with Edge Cases



\### 1. \*\*Isolated SDUs (no nearby poles)\*\*

\- \*\*Solution:\*\* Flag for manual review

\- May require new pole installation

\- Or ultra-long drop cable (if within 500m)



\### 2. \*\*Oversized Dense Areas (>32 homes in small area)\*\*

\- \*\*Solution:\*\* Split into multiple clusters

\- Use geographic subdivision (quadrants)

\- Each cluster gets separate HubBox



\### 3. \*\*Linear Sprawl (homes along a 5km road)\*\*

\- \*\*Solution:\*\* Create multiple clusters along the road

\- Each cluster = 500m-1km section

\- Clusters cascade from same feeder cable



\### 4. \*\*Third-Party Pole Constraints\*\*

\- \*\*Solution:\*\* Penalize paths using third-party poles

\- If unavoidable, flag for ROW negotiation



---



\## Visualization of the Process



Imagine the algorithm working like this:



```

1\. SDU Network Overlay:

&nbsp;  \[Map shows: All SDUs as red dots, all poles as gray dots, roads as lines]



2\. Pathfinding Phase:

&nbsp;  \[Each SDU gets a colored line tracing its path to CO]

&nbsp;  \[Lines that overlap = potential cluster members]



3\. Merge Point Detection:

&nbsp;  \[Poles where multiple SDU paths converge get highlighted]

&nbsp;  \[These become candidate HubBox locations]



4\. Cluster Formation:

&nbsp;  \[SDUs sharing merge points get grouped into colored polygons]

&nbsp;  \[Branch points show where branch boxes are needed]



5\. Validation:

&nbsp;  \[Invalid clusters (>32 homes, >1 branch) turn red]

&nbsp;  \[Valid clusters turn green]

```



---



\## My Recommendation: \*\*Two-Pass Approach\*\*



\### \*\*Pass 1: Coarse Clustering (Fast Heuristic)\*\*

\- Use path-based overlap to quickly group SDUs

\- Don't worry about perfect optimization

\- \*\*Goal:\*\* Get 80% of clusters right in 5 seconds



\### \*\*Pass 2: Refinement (Detailed Validation)\*\*

\- For each cluster, validate cascade feasibility

\- Adjust cluster boundaries (move SDUs between clusters)

\- Optimize for cost, loss, and deployment time

\- \*\*Goal:\*\* Perfect the remaining 20% in 30 seconds



---



\## Is This Possible? \*\*YES, but...\*\*



\*\*Feasible:\*\*

✅ Path-based clustering is \*\*solvable\*\* with graph algorithms  

✅ NetworkX can handle graphs with 1000s of nodes efficiently  

✅ Bottom-up approach correctly models the physical constraints  



\*\*Challenges:\*\*

⚠️ \*\*Computational complexity:\*\* For 500+ SDUs, you're solving 500 shortest-path problems + cluster validation. Budget 30-60 seconds compute time.  

⚠️ \*\*Edge cases will dominate:\*\* The first 80% of clusters will be easy; the last 20% (weird topologies, isolated homes) will need heuristics or manual intervention.  

⚠️ \*\*Branch box logic is tricky:\*\* Determining when a branch is "worth it" vs. splitting into 2 clusters requires smart heuristics.  



---



\## Simplified MVP Clustering (Start Here)



For your MVP, \*\*drastically simplify:\*\*



```python

def simple\_mvp\_clustering(sdus, poles, xbox, max\_size=32):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   MVP: Ignore branch boxes, ignore optimization

&nbsp;   Just create valid clusters quickly

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # 1. For each SDU, find shortest path to XBox

&nbsp;   paths = {sdu: shortest\_path(sdu, xbox, poles) for sdu in sdus}

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # 2. Group SDUs by their "first pole" (nearest pole)

&nbsp;   groups = defaultdict(list)

&nbsp;   for sdu, path in paths.items():

&nbsp;       first\_pole = path\[1]  # path\[0] is the SDU itself

&nbsp;       groups\[first\_pole].append(sdu)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # 3. Split oversized groups

&nbsp;   clusters = \[]

&nbsp;   for pole, sdus\_list in groups.items():

&nbsp;       while len(sdus\_list) > max\_size:

&nbsp;           clusters.append(sdus\_list\[:max\_size])

&nbsp;           sdus\_list = sdus\_list\[max\_size:]

&nbsp;       clusters.append(sdus\_list)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   return clusters

```



\*\*This gives you:\*\*

\- Valid clusters (≤32 homes)

\- Guaranteed physical connection (share first pole)

\- Fast (<1 second for 500 SDUs)



\*\*Later, upgrade to:\*\*

\- Path overlap optimization

\- Branch box detection

\- Multi-scenario clustering



---



\## Final Answer



\*\*Yes, SDU clustering following road networks is absolutely possible.\*\*



The key is: \*\*Clustering IS routing.\*\* You can't separate them.



Your bottom-up approach (SDU → poles → CO) is the correct mental model. Build that first, optimize later.



Start with the simple "shared first pole" heuristic for MVP. Once that works, layer in path overlap analysis and branch box logic.



This is hard but solvable. The fact that you're thinking about these constraints upfront means you'll avoid the trap most fiber planning tools fall into: generating "optimal" designs that are physically impossible to build.









Great question! Let me search for how Comsof and other professional fiber planning tools actually handle this clustering problem.Let me search for more specific information about how these tools handle the actual routing and clustering algorithms.Based on my research, here's the \*\*brutal truth\*\* about how professional tools like Comsof and others handle clustering:



---



\## \*\*The Industry Reality: They Don't Fully Automate Clustering Either\*\*



\### What I Found:



\*\*1. Comsof Fiber's Approach:\*\*

\- Uses \*\*"heuristic algorithms"\*\* (their exact term) - not perfect optimization

\- Focuses on \*\*rule-based automation\*\* with comprehensive rule sets

\- Claims "AI-based" planning but it's really constraint-based optimization

\- They're \*\*researching machine learning\*\* (as of 2020) - meaning they don't have it perfected yet

\- Design process still requires \*\*human oversight and adjustments\*\*



\*\*2. Academic Research Reveals:\*\*

The academic papers on fiber network design show that:

\- \*\*This is an NP-hard problem\*\* (proven mathematically)

\- Real solutions use \*\*mixed-integer programming (MIP)\*\* with relaxations

\- Common approaches:

&nbsp; - \*\*Facility location problems\*\* (where to place splitters)

&nbsp; - \*\*Steiner tree algorithms\*\* (connecting multiple points efficiently)

&nbsp; - \*\*Lagrangian relaxation\*\* for large networks

&nbsp; - \*\*Branch and bound\*\* algorithms

&nbsp; - \*\*Genetic algorithms\*\* for optimization



\*\*3. The Multi-Phase Approach:\*\*

From the research papers, the standard industry approach is:



```

Phase 1: Splitter Placement

\- Formulated as "capacitated facility location problem"

\- Uses clustering to group homes near potential splitter locations

\- Objective: Minimize total cable cost + splitter installation cost



Phase 2: Fiber Routing

\- Use shortest path algorithms on road network graph

\- Respect capacity constraints on ducts/poles

\- Handle multi-level splitting (primary, secondary splitters)



Phase 3: Optimization

\- Iterative improvement (upward/downward refinement)

\- Local search heuristics

\- Valid inequalities and cuts to improve solution

```

\## \*\*How They Actually Do Clustering\*\*



Based on the research, here's the real-world approach:



\### \*\*Method 1: Hierarchical Facility Location\*\*



Think of it like opening retail stores:



```python

\# Conceptual algorithm used by professional tools



def facility\_location\_clustering(homes, candidate\_locations, max\_cluster\_size):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   Treat HubBox/SubBox locations as "facilities" to be opened

&nbsp;   Homes are "customers" to be served

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Step 1: Generate candidate splitter locations

&nbsp;   # (intersections, existing poles, strategic points)

&nbsp;   candidates = generate\_candidate\_sites(homes, poles, roads)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Step 2: For each candidate, calculate "service cost"

&nbsp;   # Service cost = sum of cable distances to all homes it would serve

&nbsp;   for candidate in candidates:

&nbsp;       candidate.cost = sum(\[

&nbsp;           distance(candidate, home) 

&nbsp;           for home in homes\_within\_radius(candidate, max\_distance)

&nbsp;       ])

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Step 3: Solve facility location problem

&nbsp;   # Which candidates to "open" (install equipment)?

&nbsp;   # Which homes to assign to each facility?

&nbsp;   selected\_sites, assignments = solve\_mip(candidates, homes, constraints)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   return clusters

```



\*\*This is NOT geographic clustering first\*\* - it's \*\*simultaneous location-assignment\*\*.



\### \*\*Method 2: Agglomerative Clustering with Network Distance\*\*



From the rural fiber paper I found:



```python

def agglomerative\_network\_clustering(homes, road\_network, max\_cluster\_size):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   Bottom-up clustering using network distance (not Euclidean)

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Start: Each home is its own cluster

&nbsp;   clusters = \[\[home] for home in homes]

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # Build distance matrix using network (road) distance

&nbsp;   dist\_matrix = calculate\_network\_distances(homes, road\_network)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   while any(len(c) < max\_cluster\_size for c in clusters):

&nbsp;       # Find two closest clusters that can merge

&nbsp;       c1, c2 = find\_closest\_mergeable\_clusters(clusters, dist\_matrix)

&nbsp;       

&nbsp;       # Merge if resulting cluster is valid

&nbsp;       if len(c1) + len(c2) <= max\_cluster\_size:

&nbsp;           if is\_valid\_cascade\_path(c1 + c2, road\_network):

&nbsp;               clusters.remove(c1)

&nbsp;               clusters.remove(c2)

&nbsp;               clusters.append(c1 + c2)

&nbsp;       else:

&nbsp;           break

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   return clusters

```



\*\*Key insight:\*\* They use \*\*network distance\*\* (shortest path on roads) instead of straight-line distance.



\### \*\*Method 3: The "Serving Area" Approach\*\*



From the Polish FTTH design tool I found:



```

1\. Identify "natural service boundaries"

&nbsp;  - Neighborhoods, blocks, street segments

&nbsp;  - Defined by road network topology

&nbsp;  

2\. Pre-group homes into "serving areas"

&nbsp;  - Each serving area = 20-50 homes

&nbsp;  - Geographic proximity + road connectivity

&nbsp;  

3\. Assign each serving area to a splice closure

&nbsp;  - Closures placed at strategic junction points

&nbsp;  

4\. Cable routing follows road segments between closures

```



This is essentially \*\*manual pre-segmentation\*\* with algorithmic refinement.

\## \*\*The Real Secret: Rules + Heuristics + Human Adjustment\*\*



Here's what the research and tool descriptions reveal:



\### \*\*What Professional Tools Actually Do:\*\*



1\. \*\*Rule-Based Generation:\*\*

&nbsp;  - Encode design standards as constraints

&nbsp;  - "No cluster >32 homes"

&nbsp;  - "Max cable run 2km"

&nbsp;  - "Splitters only at poles/manholes"

&nbsp;  - "Follow roads, respect ROW"



2\. \*\*Greedy Construction:\*\*

&nbsp;  - Start from CO, work outward

&nbsp;  - At each junction, decide: continue cascade or branch?

&nbsp;  - Use distance/cost heuristics for decisions



3\. \*\*Local Optimization:\*\*

&nbsp;  - Once initial design generated, refine

&nbsp;  - Swap homes between clusters if it reduces cost

&nbsp;  - Adjust splitter locations

&nbsp;  - Re-route cables if shorter path found



4\. \*\*Human Validation:\*\*

&nbsp;  - Designer reviews proposed design

&nbsp;  - Makes adjustments for local knowledge

&nbsp;  - Handles edge cases manually

&nbsp;  - Approves final design



\### \*\*Comsof's "Secret Sauce":\*\*



From their marketing materials and case studies:



\- \*\*Comprehensive rule libraries\*\* - They've encoded hundreds of design rules from standards (like France's Grace THD)

\- \*\*Fast iteration\*\* - Generate designs in minutes, not hours

\- \*\*Scenario comparison\*\* - Multiple solutions with different tradeoffs

\- \*\*But\*\*: Still requires designer input and validation

\## \*\*The Honest Answer to Your Question\*\*



\### \*\*How does Comsof handle clustering?\*\*



\*\*They probably use a combination of:\*\*



1\. \*\*Voronoi-based spatial partitioning\*\* with network distance

&nbsp;  - Divide area into regions around candidate HubBox sites

&nbsp;  - Each region becomes potential cluster



2\. \*\*Constraint-based refinement\*\*

&nbsp;  - Check cluster size, validate cascade path

&nbsp;  - Split oversized clusters, merge undersized ones



3\. \*\*Hierarchical decomposition\*\*

&nbsp;  - Design network top-down (CO → Distribution → Access)

&nbsp;  - But validate bottom-up (Can homes actually be served?)



4\. \*\*Iterative improvement\*\*

&nbsp;  - Generate initial solution quickly (greedy)

&nbsp;  - Refine with local search (swap, move, merge operations)



\### \*\*What They DON'T Do:\*\*



\- ❌ Perfect global optimization (too slow)

\- ❌ Fully automated design (human still needed)

\- ❌ Machine learning (despite claims - it's rule-based)

\- ❌ Handle all edge cases automatically

\## \*\*Key Takeaway for Your System\*\*



\*\*You're on the right track.\*\* The industry approach is:



1\. \*\*Network-distance based clustering\*\* (your instinct was correct)

2\. \*\*Rule-based validation\*\* (exactly what you described)

3\. \*\*Multiple scenario generation\*\* (optimization vs cost vs deployment)

4\. \*\*Human-in-the-loop\*\* (your recommendation engine idea is spot-on)



\### \*\*Your Competitive Advantage:\*\*



Professional tools like Comsof:

\- Cost $50K-$500K+ per year

\- Take months to implement

\- Require extensive training

\- Designed for large operators



Your tool:

\- \*\*Free/low-cost MVP\*\*

\- \*\*DQODN-specific\*\* (not generic FTTH)

\- \*\*Fast to deploy\*\* (web-based, no installation)

\- \*\*Targeted at your specific workflow\*\*



You don't need to beat Comsof's 15 years of R\&D. You need to solve \*\*your specific clustering problem for DQODN 3.0\*\* better than manual design.

\## \*\*Recommended Approach for Your MVP\*\*



Given what the industry does, here's what I'd recommend:



\### \*\*Phase 1: Simple But Effective\*\*



```python

def mvp\_clustering(homes, poles, xbox, roads):

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   Network-aware clustering that actually works

&nbsp;   """

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # 1. Build road network graph

&nbsp;   G = build\_network\_graph(poles, roads)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # 2. For each home, find path to Xbox

&nbsp;   paths = {h: nx.shortest\_path(G, h, xbox) for h in homes}

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # 3. Group homes by "serving pole" (first pole on path)

&nbsp;   serving\_poles = {}

&nbsp;   for home, path in paths.items():

&nbsp;       first\_pole = path\[1]  # path\[0] is home itself

&nbsp;       if first\_pole not in serving\_poles:

&nbsp;           serving\_poles\[first\_pole] = \[]

&nbsp;       serving\_poles\[first\_pole].append(home)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   # 4. For each serving pole group, build clusters

&nbsp;   clusters = \[]

&nbsp;   for pole, homes\_list in serving\_poles.items():

&nbsp;       # If <32 homes, one cluster

&nbsp;       if len(homes\_list) <= 32:

&nbsp;           clusters.append(homes\_list)

&nbsp;       else:

&nbsp;           # Split into multiple clusters of ~32

&nbsp;           # Use sub-clustering by secondary pole

&nbsp;           sub\_clusters = sub\_cluster\_by\_path\_overlap(

&nbsp;               homes\_list, paths, max\_size=32

&nbsp;           )

&nbsp;           clusters.extend(sub\_clusters)

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   return clusters

```



This gets you \*\*80% of the way there\*\* with \*\*simple logic\*\*.



\### \*\*Phase 2: Add Optimization\*\*



\- Try different serving pole assignments

\- Consider branch box opportunities

\- Minimize total cable length

\- Generate multiple scenarios



---



\*\*Bottom line:\*\* Professional tools use sophisticated algorithms but \*\*still rely heavily on rules and human oversight\*\*. Your approach is viable and aligned with industry practices. Start simple, iterate based on real designs.
