# Google Earth Engine Accuracy Improvements

## Problem Solved

The Atlas API was previously returning **inaccurate/incomplete results** compared to manual Google Earth Engine queries due to several issues:

### Issues Identified:
1. **Arbitrary Feature Limits**: Hard-coded 10,000 feature limit per data source
2. **Inefficient Export Method**: Using `getInfo()` instead of optimized batch processing
3. **No Size Awareness**: Same processing approach for small and large datasets
4. **Missing Transparency**: No indication of data completeness

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Size-Based Processing
```python
# Before: Always limited to 10,000 features
limited_buildings = filtered_buildings.limit(10000)

# After: Size-aware processing
feature_count = filtered_buildings.size().getInfo()
if feature_count > sampling_threshold:
    # Apply systematic sampling
elif feature_count > simplification_threshold:
    # Apply geometry simplification  
else:
    # Extract all features (no limits)
```

### 2. Configurable Thresholds
- `GEE_MAX_FEATURES=100000` (default: 100k vs old 10k limit)
- `GEE_SIMPLIFICATION_THRESHOLD=25000` (apply geometry simplification)
- `GEE_SAMPLING_THRESHOLD=50000` (apply systematic sampling)

### 3. Processing Transparency
Features now include metadata:
```json
{
  "properties": {
    "atlas_source": "google_buildings",
    "atlas_processed_features": 45123,
    "atlas_total_available": 47890,
    // ... other properties
  }
}
```

### 4. Systematic Sampling
For large datasets, uses Earth Engine's `randomColumn()` for spatially distributed sampling:
```python
sampled_buildings = filtered_buildings.randomColumn('random').sort('random').limit(max_features)
```

## Comparison: Manual GEE vs Atlas API

| Aspect | Manual Earth Engine | Atlas API (Fixed) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Data Source** | `GOOGLE/Research/open-buildings/v3/polygons` | ✅ Identical |
| **Data Version** | May 2023 (latest) | ✅ Identical |
| **Feature Limits** | Memory/timeout limits | ✅ Configurable (up to 100k) |
| **Processing** | `Export.table.toDrive()` | ✅ Optimized batch processing |
| **Accuracy** | Full dataset (until memory limits) | ✅ High fidelity with intelligent sampling |

## Configuration for Maximum Accuracy

Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Maximum accuracy settings
GEE_MAX_FEATURES=100000
GEE_SIMPLIFICATION_THRESHOLD=25000  
GEE_SAMPLING_THRESHOLD=50000
```

## Usage Recommendations

### For Maximum Accuracy (No Sampling):
- Keep AOI size < 5 km² for dense urban areas
- Use rectangular AOIs when possible
- Enable only needed data sources

### For Large Areas:
- Accept systematic sampling (maintains spatial distribution)
- Check `atlas_processed_features` vs `atlas_total_available` in results
- Consider breaking into smaller AOIs if 100% coverage needed

## API Response Changes

The `/data-sources` endpoint now includes accuracy information:
```json
{
  "accuracy_notes": {
    "vs_manual_earth_engine": {
      "data_source": "Identical - same Earth Engine collections",
      "processing": "API uses intelligent sampling for large datasets",
      "accuracy": "High fidelity maintained",
      "recommendation": "For >50k features, consider smaller AOI"
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing the Fix

Run the test script to verify improvements:
```bash
python test_accuracy_fix.py
```

This will show:
- Processing statistics
- Feature count comparisons
