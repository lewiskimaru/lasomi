I'm experiencing a critical issue with the Atlas GIS application's multi-source data extraction functionality. Based on the build logs in `docs/dev/buildlogs.md`, when users request data from multiple sources (as shown in the recent query logs), the server is returning 404 errors instead of the expected data.

**Specific Issues to Investigate:**

1. **Server-side 404 Errors**: Analyze the build logs to identify which API endpoints are returning 404 responses during multi-source data requests
2. **Browser Console Errors**: Examine any client-side JavaScript errors that correlate with the 404 responses
3. **Data Source Processing**: Determine if the issue affects all data sources or only specific combinations (Google Buildings, OSM Roads, OSM Landmarks, etc.)

**Required Analysis:**

1. **Root Cause Investigation**: 
   - Trace the request flow from frontend to backend
   - Identify where in the processing pipeline the 404 errors originate
   - Determine if this is a routing issue, data processing failure, or export/download problem

2. **Error Pattern Analysis**:
   - Check if errors occur during data extraction, processing, or export phases
   - Verify if the issue is specific to certain data source combinations
   - Analyze timing - does this happen immediately or after processing completes?

3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Confirm which application functions are still working correctly
   - Identify any regression from recent changes (building processor, export fixes, UI updates)

**Solution Requirements:**

1. **Step-by-step Fix**: Provide a systematic approach to resolve each identified issue
2. **Preservation of Working Features**: Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality like:
   - Single-source data extraction
   - Design upload and rendering
   - Map functionality and UI interactions
   - Export functionality for successful jobs

3. **Prevention Strategy**: Implement measures to prevent this issue from recurring, including:
   - Better error handling
   - Improved logging for debugging
   - Validation of multi-source request processing

**Deliverables:**
- Clear explanation of what exactly happened and why
- Specific code fixes with file locations and line numbers
- Testing approach to verify the solution works
- Preventive measures to avoid future occurrences

Please analyze the build logs thoroughly, identify the exact failure points, and provide a comprehensive solution that maintains the application's stability while fixing the multi-source data request issues.
